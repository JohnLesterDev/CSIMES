## Features

CSIMES offers a range of features that make inventory management a breeze. Some of the key features of this system include:

- **Dedicated Security Control Feature**: The system offers a dedicated security control feature that ensures the security of all processes, names, credentials, and information within the system.

- **Ease-of-Use and User-Friendliness**: The system mantra is ease-of-use and being user-friendly. The system offers auto-login with correct credentials, several hotkeys, and system automation for user convenience.

- **Lock File Feature**: The system includes a lock file feature, which ensures that only one instance of the system is launched for security and server purposes.

- **Custom SQL-like Database**: The database is a from-scratch custom SQL-like database that uses TCP/IP connection locally. The server handles all files, such as products, orders, and logs, and the system connects to the server locally for security and performance reasons. The database that the server implements is also a file system of the user's device.

- **Panels for Easy Navigation**: The main page includes five panels: Dashboard, Inventory, POS, History Log, and User Management. Each panel has dedicated features that align with the system's ease-of-use and user-friendliness mantra.

- **Sidebar Feature and Dashboard Panel**: The system offers two ways to access the aformentioned panels: via the sidebar feature or inside the dashboard panel, which are the first to show up during launch.

- **Auto-Sync Update to Server Feature**: The system includes a full-blown auto-sync to server feature that updates the server and the database for all processes involving the database's content during runtime. The latest information is automatically displayed, providing real-time updates to the user.
